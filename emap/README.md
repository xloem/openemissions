# What is this?

'emap' is a project I began to create a generic framework for use of an SDR for hobby emissions work (fingerprinting devices based on emissions, van eck phreaking, making crude measurements of shielding effectiveness).

The goal was to make it intelligent and modular, kind of an all-purpose tool, similar to nmap but for raw wireless data.

It does not presently function.
