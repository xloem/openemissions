"Quadrature" is how the Rtl-Sdr receives high frequency signals.

Basically, as I understand it, a given frequency is "tuned" to: a "virtual" signal operating
at this frequency may be imagined.  For each sample, two values are generated, sampled at
precise phase times for the imaginary signal.  One is at 0 degrees and one at 90 degrees.

If these samples are then provided as the real and imaginary components of a complex number,
it is as if the real signal has been multiplied by e^(pi i ...etc) with the proper tuning
frequency, in the same way as is done in the Fourier transform.

If a Fourier transform is then taken of this data, the end result is frequency shifted down
by the tuning frequency, such that the output, centered around zero, shows what would be
the decomposition of the input, centered around the tuning frequency, with bandwidth equal
to sampling rate.

I believe the original signal may be reconstructed from the Fourier transform, by treating
the frequencies as offset in this way.
