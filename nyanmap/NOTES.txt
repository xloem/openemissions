note:
	-> adaptive subdivision to pick angles, starting near origin for speed
	-> blind source separation to separate signals
			need some heuristic/approach here to only use constant signals
			if recordings are at different times.  could use multiple gymbals.
		-> the blind source separation on constant signals will form a spherical antenna
		   function that can be used to transform data.  each signal ideally would sample
		   this antenna function in its mixing/unmixing vector.  so after BSS of many
		   signals, the mixing/unmixing vectors would ideally be alignable to form
		   a detailed antenna function.  then as signals are counted they can be precisely
		   unmixed by procedurally forming mixing matrices based on the known properties
		   and a detailed image of the room mapped.
			-> if it works, this approach might be integratable into a bss system to
			   reduce needed recordings from the start.
	-> bno055 modes:
		IMUPLUS_MODE relative-orientation, high data rate, magnetometer disabled
		NDOF_MODE fused absoloute-orientation
		NDOF_FMC_OFF_MODE same as NDOF but fast magnetometer calibration off
	   drivers:
		~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/adafruit_bno055.py
	   the bno055 has a uart mode where it won't contend on i2c and might offer continuous data
	   at a constant rate. this also avoids an old raspberry pi bug with its i2c
	   clock-stretching.  the device may support spi too.

1. plug the nyansat motor controller and imu into the I2C pins of a raspberry pi
   the esp32 is unneeded and slows the build-test loop.

2. git clone https://github.com/xloem/antenny
the nyansat/station subfolder has been ported to mainstream python using the circuitpython libraries

3. cd nyansat/station; python3

4. import antenny
   api = esp32_antenny.antenna_api_factory() # todo: rename from esp32
   calibration = api.pwm_calibration()

hw notes:
	a robotic arm kit on aliexpress uses servos RDS3115MG DS3115MG; is this the same?
	far better precision could be obtained by calibrating continuous-rotation servos,
	somebody used tower pro mg995.  it might also be possible to 'nudge' the servos and depower
	them quickly, for precision.
