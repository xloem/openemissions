# freesdr

Some reusable work towards working with signals, intended to very generic but with a focus on Pothos and ROOT.

Why Pothos?
  - the rtl-sdr libraries are hosted on github and the maintainer is responsive, making contribution more accessible

Why ROOT?
  - it provids a gateway to powerful analysis of information
