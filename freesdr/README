# freesdr

Some reusable work towards working with signals, intended to be very generic.


Focuses:

GnuRadio:
  - this task is difficult enough that supporting any issues near the gnu community is actually easier than completing it

Pothos: (deprecated, less ideal philosophy than gnu)
  - the rtl-sdr libraries are hosted on github (osmosdr uses a private system) and the maintainer is responsive, making contribution more accessible

ROOT: (possibly on hold, is rather heavy weight, not used by radio devs much)
  - it provides a gateway to powerful analysis of information
  -> use Tensorflow over ROOT.  Tensorflow is widely developed and very fast.
