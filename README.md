# OpenEmissions

OpenEmissions is focused around building open solutions to wireless information security problems that are presently not commonly available,
and providing tools to aid in experimenting with and understanding electromagnetics for hobbyists.

This project was started by Karl Semich (xloem), who does not have any professional or academic experience in this area, but is passionate about it.

The github repository here is configured to allow automatic merging of pull requests.  This must be activated in the pull request UI.

Project ideas:
- consolidated public resources for making shielded spaces
- consolidated indexes of known security issues
- software tools for using commonly available radios
  - to fingerprint devices based on their emissions
  - to sniff data (keystrokes, memory, video) based on wireless emissions
  - to measure shielding effectiveness
  - to assist in detecting hidden devices or unidentified transmitters
  - to automatically identify and categorize wireless traffic

  - there is an openemissions wiki on github that needs to be merged into the repo so its history is kept on git: https://github.com/xloem/openemissions/wiki git history at https://github.com/xloem/openemissions.wiki .  README.md could be turned into a symlink to home, and the repository contents shared?
  - i believe there is also a gitlab wiki
