# OpenEmissions

OpenEmissions is focused around building open solutions to wireless information security problems that are presently not commonly available,
and providing tools to aid in experimenting with and understanding electromagnetics for hobbyists.

This project was started by Karl Semich (xloem), who does not have any professional or academic experience in this area, but is passionate about it.

Project ideas:
- consolidated public resources for making shielded spaces
- consolidated indexes of known security issues
- software tools for using commonly available radios
  - to fingerprint devices based on their emissions
  - to sniff data (keystrokes, memory, video) based on wireless emissions
  - to measure shielding effectiveness
  - to assist in detecting hidden devices or unidentified transmitters
  - to automatically identify and categorize wireless traffic
