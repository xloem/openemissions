I used rtl_sdr to make 3 raw iq recordings from an rtl-sdr while running noiscillate at 40 hz on
a noise generator.

One without the noise generator active.  One with no antenna attached.  And one with an antenna.
I had to move the setup a ways to connect it to the big antenna.

I was running on a raspberry pi, so there could have been samples dropped due to write delay.
