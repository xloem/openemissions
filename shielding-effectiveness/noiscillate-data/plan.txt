My reference material has a definition of the sampling standard deviation
that results in imaginary numbers when the samples are mostly between zero and
one.  I need to learn more stats and correctly use the t distribution and
chi-squared distributions.

The plan is to to upgrade to use boost::math and boost::accumulator, and
to change all the code to be built around these libraries.  The will be robust
replacements for my accumulators and distribution methods.  I will still need
wrapping classes to handle the meaning of the distribution methods, and converting
the convolution will be a little confusing because the boost accumulators create
histograms in a different way.
