- [ ] add logging to the generator to compare timestamps precisely

- [ ] close files after no updates after some expiration time.  this will allow archive scripts to move in

- [ ] separate out measurement function from noise source class, so that other measurement approaches can be swapped out
- [ ] generate single site survey charts graphing noise power vs frequency
- [ ] generate comparative site survey charts showing SE, attenuation etc
        -> note, this is similar to antenna measurements ... might want to check what rtl-sdr users are currently doing
- [ ] measurement idea?: average a freq-wide window around the peaks to produce a common shape, then compare peak max to floor min
