- [ ] determine stability of read power magnitude
  find why it is unstable; can stability be predicted?
- [X] fix bug where corruption is read while reading during writing
- [ ] fix bug where file updates are no longer noticed.  maybe this happens after the corruption fix? but stat should notice size changes!
- [ ] output version and configuration info so that logs have a record to help interpret data
- [X] close files after no updates after some expiration time.  this will allow archive scripts to move in

- [X] add logging to the generator to compare timestamps precisely
  -> note the pi has no hwclock to maintain time across power cycles without the internet

- [X] separate out measurement function from noise source class, so that other measurement approaches can be swapped out
- [ ] generate single site survey charts graphing noise power vs frequency
- [ ] generate comparative site survey charts showing SE, attenuation etc
        -> note, this is similar to antenna measurements ... might want to check what rtl-sdr users are currently doing
- [X] measurement idea?: average a freq-wide window around the peaks to produce a common shape, then compare peak max to floor min
