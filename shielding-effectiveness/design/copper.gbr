G04

gerber file, easy to read
each gerber file is one 'layer' of a pcb, specified by its listed attributes
full spec at https://www.ucamco.com/files/downloads/file_en/416/the-gerber-file-format-specification-revision-2020-09-update_en.pdf

made of block commands and extended commands
block commands have a code of G,D,or M and are ended by an asterisk
extended commands have 2-character codes and are surrounded by percentage signs
this text is a comment (G04 spec 4.1) and they can't include percentage or asterisk signs

I've never printed a pcb before, but I wonder if pcb printing could be used to make
incredibly tiny holes in copper in a way useful for an air vent.

NOTE: specpage 121, 4.14 numerical accuracy, says precision goes to +- 0.5 micrometers.
      additionally, the output device must state its accuracy.

G04
sets the coordinate format and resolution (FSLA; the LA is for legacy compatibility)
to 2 integer digits and a maximum of 6 fractional digits
(X and Y must be equal, fract digits must be 5 or 6)
*
%FSLAX26Y26*%


G04 required, sets file attribute (TF spec 5.2) to specify file function
    Copper is copper layer
    Plated is plated drill/rout data
    NonPlated is non-plated drill/rout data
    Profile is board proflie or outline
    Soldermask is solder resist
    Legend is silkscreen
    Component is component information
    Paste is solder paste locations
    Glue is glue spots to fix components prior to soldering
    Carbonmask,Goldmask,Heatsinkmask,Peelablemask,Silvermask,Tinmask are like Soldermask
    Depthrout is routing information that does not pass though the board
    Vcut is score lines
    Drillmap is a drawing with drill locations
*
%TF.FileFunction,Copper,L1,Top,Plane*%

G04 required, sets that the image represents the presence (Positive) of material.
    drill files are positive.
    solder mask files are negative.*
%TF.FilePolarity,Positive*%

G04 required, specifies that all coordinates are aligned for the 'test' dataset*
%TF.SameCoordinates,test*%

G04 sets the unit (MO) to millimeters (MM); inches (IN) are deprecated*
%MOMM*%

G04 define the next aperture is conductor
    see spec 5.6.10 .AperFunction for all the aperture functions*
%TA.AperFunction.Conductor*%

G04 define aperture (AD) 10 (D10, number must be >=10) as a rectangle (R) that's 1x1 mm*
%ADD10R,1X1*%

G04 define aperture (AD) 20 (D20, number must be >=10) as a circle (C) with radius 1 um*
%ADD20C,0.001*%

G04 AB opens a block aperture statement and assigns its aperture number, or closes*
G04 one (spec 4.11).  SR opens or closes a step and repeat statement*


G04 set polarity (LP) to dark (D) instead of clear (C)*
G04 in a copper pour, dark polarity indicates copper*
%LPD*%

G04 Sets the current aperture (D) to 10, the rectangle*
D10*

G04 flash(D03) current aperture, the rectangle, to (0,0)*
X000000Y000000D03*

G04 set polarity (LP) to clear (C) instead of dark (D)*
%LPC*%

G04 set size scaling (LS) to 100%*
%LS1.0*%

G04 Sets the current aperture (D) to 20, the circle*
D20*

G04 step and repeat (SR) following commands
     in a 333 square array with 3 micrometer cells*
%SRX333Y333I0.003J0.003*%

G04 flash(D03) current aperture, the circle, to (-.5,-.5) fixed-point*
X-00500000Y-00500000D03*

G04 close step and repeat*

G04 end the file*
