# What is noiscillate

Noiscillate is a hobby prototype idea for cheaply measure the attenuation of
shielding by using a noise source on a relay that oscillates it.  The receiver
discerns the rate of oscillation and compares the active data to the inactive
data to guess the attenuation.

# Theory prototype 1: oscillating noise source

I'm not the smartest, so it's best to try things to get smarter.

Noise source emits EM signal noise function, which at the receiver is present
as Rn(t).  This signal oscillates in what is roughly a square wave, for example
with a relay.

During inactive time, receiver receives only Rb(t) the background signal.

During active time, receiver receives Rb(t) + Rn(t) = Rr(t).

When the signal is weak, heuristics can't differentiate between active and
inactive time periods.  So, we separate the problem of keeping the receiver in
sync with the emitter from that of measuring the signal, and compare the
probability distributions of the active and inactive timeperiods to discern the
strength of Rn(t).  Now, summation over time can be used to increase sensitivity
if the signal is very weak.

First, estimate the probability distribution of Rn(t) from our observations of
the probability distributions of Rr(t) and Rb(t), possibly using e.g. the
convolution theorem for the sum of two independent random variables, which is
not complex.

Then, discern mean electromagnetic properties such as relative power by solving
from the distribution of Rn(t).

# Prototype Part 1a: Plotting of a waveform for review

Given a guess as to the period of the signal, plot the accumulated shape
visually, as if an oscilloscope had a trigger set for it.  Each time point in
the plot would be a fully colored column, like in a spectrogram, but of the
frequency of occurrences of different signal powers, rather than spectral
decomposition.

# TODOs

- [ ] plot waveform details as if period were known
	- [ ] choose whether to make a new project, or continue an old
		- [ ] identify existing work in this repository
